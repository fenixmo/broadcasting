# Creating a Twitch Highlight
A Twitch highlight serves two purposes: 
1. Condensing the broadcast for export to YouTube.
2. Creating a permanent instance of the broadcast in Twitch to prevent expiration (60 days)

The following procedures outline the creation of a Twitch highlight:

## Broadcasts to be Highlighted
> See [pending videos](https://twitch-video-manager.herokuapp.com/pending) (site currently in development to automate the following process)
1. Open the Techlahoma [Twitch Highlights Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cJqVigTtYIMWPtaYsagYzyYBV1EHO1HTTjpYIt_9Nag)
1. Select a broadcast with no name in the `Highlighter Name` column.
1. Put your first name in the `Highlighter Name` column.
1. Follow the `Twitch Highlighting Link`. If blank, follow the steps below in the **Video Producer** section.

## Highlighting the Video

1. Set the **Start** and **End** times according to the beginning and end of the talk itself.  
![Highlighter Menu](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/techlahoma/broadcasting/master/TwitchHighlighting/Highlighter%20Menu.PNG)  
*Exclude the "dead time" (timer, introduction, etc) before the talk and please remember to keep about 30 seconds of "dead" time at the end of the video if possible. Use your best judgment for any awkward time before the talk begins or during the Q&A.*

2. Click **Publish Highlights**.

## Editing Highlight Information

| *Highlight Edit Panel* |  

3. Name the highlight using the following format:  
**`Talk Title - Speaker Name: Event/Group`**  
*Use the title from the [Highlight List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cJqVigTtYIMWPtaYsagYzyYBV1EHO1HTTjpYIt_9Nag). The title must be less than 100 characters, or the export to YouTube will fail.*

4. Provide a Description:   
See if one is provided by the speaker in the [Speaker Form Responses](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10d-1TowAgA2WIqUawxwet9GRmhd2XI8zKxREzxqOuyY/). If so, just a copy + paste. This is the preferred way to go. Include the `Summary/Abstract/Outline`, `Speaker's Bio`, and `Links to Share`.  
  
   Otherwise, try to find the event on Meetup.com and use any details provided there. The meetup link should be in the [streaming schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ga72YMOD5V038D_4GFYggbuVF-JDu3rOPxHHPaNHu-E/edit#gid=537074142)

   Twitch allows Markdown in their description, but when exporting to youtube, this markdown will be rendered as plain text.  Links however that follow the format https://www.XXXX.com will render correctly in the Youtube Description as a link instead of plain text. 
> *Note: a link needs to start with 'https://'*
   
   Make sure there is a blank line as the final line of the Description. The export process will append "--See us on twitch at http://www.twitch.tv./techlahoma" to the final line and you need a linebreak to match the above description's formatting 
   
5. The category most applicable to Twitch is now **`Science & Technology`**.

6. You have the ability to choose or add your own thumbnail. Under the video, on the left you'll see a 1 or many images auto-generated by Twitch and an upload image icon.  Check the [google drive directory](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1H--fJrjfjfgno-IQGDYdmuopM65VBrBd) to find the applicable image for the sessions and download it to your computer. Now upload the image to twitch by clicking the upload icon then confirm it is selected.

7. Click **Save Changes**.

> *The highlight is now ready for export to YouTube.*

## Exporting to YouTube

Don't Export a highlight within 24 hours of the original broadcast as per agreement with Twitch. If the talk was less than 24 hours ago, just create the highlight and mark `Need to Export?` as `yes` in the [Highlight List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cJqVigTtYIMWPtaYsagYzyYBV1EHO1HTTjpYIt_9Nag).

Add as many tags/keywords as possible when exporting to YouTube. This is how people will find the videos. Sometimes speakers provide them in the `Keyword List` in the [Speaker Form Responses](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10d-1TowAgA2WIqUawxwet9GRmhd2XI8zKxREzxqOuyY/).

For the tags, you'll always include a few things:
* `Techlahoma`
* The group's name
* The speaker's name
* A very clear keyword or set of keywords and phrases, separated by commas and without hashtags(spaces not required after commas), describing the content and how it would be searched. ( `Bootstrap, Creating a Portfolio Site` )
* Youtube allows a maximum of 500 characters for Tags, including separators(ie , or |) and each tag can be a maximum of 30 characters.
> ![Youtube Thumbnail and Tag Dashboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/techlahoma/broadcasting/master/TwitchHighlighting/Youtube-TagList.png)
* Anything else highly relevant.

Make sure you set the video to public not private. 
Do not break the video into segments.
 
> If you have access to the YouTube channel, add the videos to the relevant playlists (month, lightning talks, etc) and change Youtube Category to 'Science & Technology' from 'Gaming'. If you do not have access, mark the corresponding column in [Highlight List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cJqVigTtYIMWPtaYsagYzyYBV1EHO1HTTjpYIt_9Nag).

### Finally

For the `Need to Export?` column in the [Highlight List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cJqVigTtYIMWPtaYsagYzyYBV1EHO1HTTjpYIt_9Nag):
* If the video appears on [Techlahoma's YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/techlahoma), enter `no`. 
* If you're not able to export to YouTube for any reason, enter `yes`.
* If you give up on waiting for it to show up on YouTube, enter 'Exporting'.
